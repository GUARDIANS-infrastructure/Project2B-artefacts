# NCI Requirements: Discovery Phase

The following requirements were captured during a discovery session with NCI and will require validation via playback session:

| ID   | Requirement | MoSCoW |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| R42  | The AAI solution enables users to register to GUARDIANS services and supports SSO login. |  |
| R43  | The AAI platform will delegate service-specific authorisation, enabling access to be determined at the application or login-node level, rather than centrally. |  |
| R44  | The AAI solution supports Keycloak as an identity provider. |  |
| R45  | AAI supports manual and automated identity proofing workflows, including whitelist-based onboarding and manual vetting for users from non-trusted institutions. |  |
| R46  | Policy support is required to govern identity continuity when users move between institutions, including clearly assigned scheme manager responsibilities for access lifecycle management. |  |
