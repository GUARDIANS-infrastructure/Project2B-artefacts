| ID   | Requirement | MoSCoW |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| R35  | The AAI solution integrates with REMS to support federated authentication for users initiating data access requests. |  |
| R36  | The AAI solution supports authentication for external users from recognised institutional, academic, or commercial organisations (no access using Gmail). |  |
| R37  | The AAI solution supports access for trusted users outside the AAF, through integration with approved external identity providers. |  |
| R38  | The AAI solution supports validation of non-AAF identities by consuming assurance attributes from upstream systems. |  |
| R39  | The AAI solution enables identity-based access control by consuming attributes (e.g., roles, entitlements) linked to validated access requests. |  |
| R40  | The AAI solution supports linking user identities to public/private encryption keys for secure data sharing. |  |
| R41  | The AAI solution supports attribute-based access control (ABAC), enabling enforcement decisions based on attributes issued by REMS. |  |
