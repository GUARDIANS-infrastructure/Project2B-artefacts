The following requirements were captured during a discovery session with BioCommons and will require validation via playback session:

| ID   | Requirement | MoSCoW |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| R47  | The AAI solution provides an onboarding pathway for users outside of the AAF, including those from hospitals, MRIs, and potentially unaffiliated individuals. |  |
| R48  | The AAI solution supports role-based access control and group management, with the ability to propagate access entitlements programmatically across integrated services. |  |
| R49  | The AAI solution supports institutional login for most users, particularly those affiliated with Australian universities and research institutes. |  |
| R50  | Once data access is approved (REMS), the AAI solution should enable automatic assignment of users to relevant groups or roles, allowing programmatic access to authorised datasets. |  |
